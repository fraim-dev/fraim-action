# Fraim Security Scan GitHub Action

A GitHub Action that runs [Fraim](https://github.com/fraim-dev/fraim) AI-powered security analysis on your code and automatically uploads the results to GitHub's Security tab using SARIF format.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses advanced language models to detect security vulnerabilities
- üéØ **Smart Scanning**: Option to scan only changed files in PRs for faster feedback
- üìä **GitHub Integration**: Automatically uploads results to GitHub Security tab with annotations
- üí¨ **Automatic PR Comments**: Adds detailed comments to PRs with scan results and links
- üîß **Configurable Workflows**: Supports code security analysis and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning
- üìà **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for Google Gemini and OpenAI models
- üé® **Rich Reporting**: Generates both SARIF and HTML reports

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Add this action to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/security.yml`):

```yaml
name: Security Scan

  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      actions: read
      security-events: write
      pull-requests: write
    
    steps:
      - name: Run Fraim Security Scan
        id: fraim-scan
        uses: fraim-dev/fraim-action@v1
        with:
          gemini-api-key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
name: Comprehensive Security Scan

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly full scan

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      actions: read
      security-events: write
      pull-requests: write
    
    steps:
      - name: Run Fraim Security Scan
        uses: ./action  # Replace with actual action reference when published
        with:
          # API Configuration
          openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          model: 'openai/gpt-4.1-mini'
          
          # Scan Configuration
          workflows: 'code,iac'
          confidence: '8'
          
          # Version
          fraim-version: 'latest'
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `workflows` | Workflows to run (comma-separated). Available: `code`, `iac` | No | `code` |
| `gemini-api-key` | Google Gemini API key for AI analysis | Yes (if using Gemini model) | - |
| `openai-api-key` | OpenAI API key (alternative to Gemini) | Yes (if using OpenAI model) | - |
| `model` | AI model to use for analysis | No | `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `confidence` | Minimum confidence threshold (1-10) for filtering findings | No | `8` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sarif-file` | Path to the generated SARIF file |
| `results-count` | Number of security findings detected |

## API Key Setup

### Google Gemini

1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add it as a repository secret named `GEMINI_API_KEY`
3. Reference it in your workflow: `gemini-api-key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}`

### OpenAI

1. Get an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Add it as a repository secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Reference it in your workflow: `openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}`
4. Set the model: `model: 'openai/gpt-4.1-mini'`

## Workflows

### Code Security Analysis (`code`)
Analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities including:
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Authentication issues
- Input validation problems
- And many more security patterns

### Infrastructure as Code Analysis (`iac`)
Scans infrastructure configuration files for:
- Cloud security misconfigurations
- Compliance violations
- Best practice deviations
- Resource security settings

## Permissions Required

Your workflow needs the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # To checkout code
  actions: read           # To upload report
  security-events: write  # To upload SARIF to Security tab
  pull-requests: write    # To add PR comments and annotations
```

## PR Annotations and Comments

The action provides two types of PR feedback:

1. **SARIF Annotations**: Automatically created by GitHub when SARIF is uploaded - these appear as inline comments on specific lines of code
2. **PR Comments**: A summary comment showing scan results, configuration, and links to detailed findings

### Example PR Comment

When the action runs on a PR, it will automatically add a comment like:

```
üõ°Ô∏è Fraim Security Scan Results

Workflows: code,iac
Model: gemini/gemini-2.5-flash
Confidence threshold: 7

‚ö†Ô∏è 3 security findings detected

Fraim found 3 potential security issues. Please review the Security tab for details.

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No API Key**: Make sure you've set up either `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your repository secrets.

2. **Permission Denied**: Ensure your workflow has the required permissions (`security-events: write`).

3. **Rate Limiting**: If you hit API rate limits, consider:
   - Using a lower confidence threshold
   - Scanning only changed files in PRs
   - Adding delays between workflow runs

## Security Considerations

- API keys should be handled securely through GitHub Secrets
- SARIF files may contain code snippets - review artifact retention policies
- Consider using branch protection rules to require security scans to pass
